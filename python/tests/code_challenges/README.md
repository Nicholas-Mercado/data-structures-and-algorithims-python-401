## Singly Linked List

This is a linked list with the following methods included

- insert()
- includes()
- \_\_str__()

### Challenge

Create a Linked List class

**The class should contain the following methods**

insert

- Arguments: value
- Returns: nothing
- Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

includes

- Arguments: value
- Returns: Boolean
- Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

to string

- Arguments: none
- Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"[ a ] -> [ b ] -> [ c ] -> NULL"

### Approach & Efficiency

insert()- O(1)
includes() - O(N)
