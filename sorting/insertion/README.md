# Challenge Summary

Insertion Sort - review the pseudo code provided and create a blog post explaining the algorithm.

## Whiteboard Process

[Blog](sorting/insertion/BLOG.md)
[code](python/code_challenges/insertion_sort.py)

## Approach & Efficiency

Big 0

Time complexity O(n^2) because you always have iterate through the whole list
Space complexity O(1) because this algorithm takes up no more space then the original list
