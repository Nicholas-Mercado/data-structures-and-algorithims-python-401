# Trees

This assignment contains a binary tree class and a binary search tree class.

## Challenge

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

Create a Binary Tree class with following methods

- pre order
- in order
- post order

Create a Binary Search Tree class with following methods

- Add
- Contains

## Approach & Efficiency

big O

- Depth travesal methods have a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n)

- add method - has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1)

- Contains method - has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1)

## API

Depth traversal

- pre order
- in order
- post order

BST

- Add - adds new node to bst tree
- Contains - searches bst and returns boolean whether value found
